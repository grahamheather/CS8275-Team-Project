The data, provided by Dr. DeSouza, is recordings of the vowels a, i, and u pronounced by various speakers.  Precisely, the data contains 4 channels of sEMG readings and 2 channels of audio.

The goal of the project was to classify each of these recordings based on whether or not it is indicative of vocal fatigue.

The commands for extracting features and predicting with the classifier can be found in evaluation_instructions.txt
